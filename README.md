# ha-insnrg-chlorinator

This is a small portion of the INSNRG Pool Chlorinator API. It is currently INCOMPLETE (in case you stumbled upon it)

Currently it only pulls in pH and ORP values like from https://www.insnrgapp.com/pool-chemistry.

The integration successfully takes your email and password for the INSNRG app and logs in. Currently I'm working through fixing an error with the data retrieval.
